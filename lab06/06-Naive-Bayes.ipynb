    "# Lab 06: Generative Classifiers: Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in class, a naive Bayes classifier works as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ that could be discrete, continuous, or a mix of discrete and continuous features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also given a discrete set $\\mathcal{Y} = { y_1, \\ldots,\n",
    "y_K }$ of exhaustive, mutually exclusive classes thought to be the provenance of a dataset elements $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to say that the features come from the classes? Specifically, we mean that the observation $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ is a random vector statistically dependent on a random variable $y^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} \\sim p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y^{(i)})$, where $y^{(i)} \\in \\mathcal{Y}$ and $y^{(i)} \\sim p(y)$. $p(y)$, the *prior*, is assumed to be a multinomial distribution over the possible classes $\\mathcal{Y}$, but the class conditional distribution $p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y)$ can be an arbitrarily complicated joint distribution over the feature space that is different for each $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random process just described, in which a $y$ is first sampled from a multinomial distribution over $\\mathcal{Y}$ then an $\\mathbf{x}$ is sampled from an arbitrary joint distribution over $\\mathcal{X}$ that is conditioned on $y$, is a *generative model* for the provenance of our dataset. It may not be a fully accurate model for how nature gave us our dataset, but we nevertheless assume that it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all those preliminaries, now, given a new sample $\\mathbf{x}$ assumed to have been generated by the same generative process, we estimate, for each $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$, the *posterior* $p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ using the following strategy:\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x} ; \\theta) & = & \\frac{p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y ; \\theta) p(y ; \\theta)}{p(\\mathbf{x} ; \\theta)} \\\\\n",
    "& \\propto & p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y ; \\theta) p(y ; \\theta) \\\\\n",
    "& = & p(y ; \\theta) \\prod_j p(x_j \\mid y, x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1} ; \\theta) \\\\\n",
    "& \\approx & p(y ; \\theta) \\prod_j p(x_j \\mid y ; \\theta).\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical assumption here (besides the story of the generative random process assumed to be the origin of our dataset) is the *naive Bayes assumption* that the approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(x_j \\mid y, x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1} ; \\theta) \\approx p(x_j \\mid y ; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is close enough to reality to be useful. Note that if the features are truly *conditionally independent of each other given the class*, then the naive Bayes classifier is an exact probabilistic classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we know that the parameters of a naive Bayes classifier will always include the parameters $\\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_k$ of the multinomial distribution over $\\mathcal{Y}$ plus the individual conditional feature distributions $p(x_j \\mid y)$. If $x_j$ is discrete, we can represent this conditional distribution using a simple table of probabilities, and if $x_j$ is continuous, we represent the conditional distribution using the parameters of some continuous distribution such as a univariate Gaussian, univariate exponential, etc.\n",

So, if we just predict this without even considering other parameters then we can get as high as 90% accuracy. It means only considering the priors gives us such 90% accuracy, without even touching the features x, which we can call it as a base accuracy. So if we also consider features x then we can get accuracy higher than that. But in such case if we reject priors or do not use priors then the model will perform much more poorly than the base accuracy.\n",

    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset source: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data \n",
    "Citation Info-\n",
    "This data was first used in Bo Pang and Lillian Lee,\n",
    "Seeing stars: Exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales. Proceedings of the ACL, 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains two text files, one contains the positive movie reviews and other contains the negative movie reviews. The total number of reviews on both text files are same which is 5331, one review per line. I am going to make a Classifier using Naive Bayes Classifier that would detect whether the given review is positive review or negative review. Since the number of reviews on both classes are same, I am going to divide equally for training and test sets from both of these classes, 20% (almost 1000 reviews per class) for test purpose and 80% for training purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in the text form and it's well formatted, meaning each review in each separate line. So, it will be easier to divide dataset into train and test set. And since the positive and negative reviews are given in two separate file, I can directly load these separately with simple file loader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the dataset is well formated, the reviews itself is not so clean, meaning the reviewer has given reviews in their own way. Some reviews are in different language with non-english or near english symbol (may be french character, I don't know :) ). In addition to this there are other numeric characters (0-9) and symbols like dollar sign, at sign, comma, single quote, double quote, dash, tilde etc and few more. It's easy to filter out this if they are separately written, but that was not the case. They are written inside of some text. And the another main problem is the use of word with aposthophe sign in between the characters in word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbols that are on outside of the word can be removed by using simple strip method. But I couldn't figure out how to process the text that contains symbol inside characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another task that we can do is stemming of the word, meaning replacing the variants of word with the base word. For example, the word eat can have various forms like- eaten, ate, eats, eating. This example may not be helpful to distinguish between positive and negative reviews, but I hope this serves the purpose. It would be better if we could just do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what did I actually do? I just checked whether the word contains characters besides the alphabets, and filtered out every word that contains non-alphabetical characters. This is the most simplest form of text processing and the worst way to do text processing, since it may replace many important words (the words that serve the purpose to distinguish between positive and negative reviews). It turns out there were not much of these words. The total number of words in bag of each class is around 10,000, in words in collection of these bags is around 15,000. Hence, I was sure that this will help me to build pretty descent performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I removed the word 'the' which has count around 5000, almost same as number of reviews, and some other two letter words (not-so-important word and some of them are not even a word) except some important one from the training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't use any fancy text processing library. I just used the pandas to load the dataset and process the texts and store the bag of words and almost everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains parameters like priors of each class, which in my case it's 0.5, since the number of data for each class is the same. And the other parameters are the probability of texts for each class. The calculations are made easy by the pandas dataframe and series data structures. Like wise during testing, the accessing of the probability of each words from the collection of bag of words is also made easy by the pandas series data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "The scores of my model for each class are listed below:\\\n",
    "**Score for positive class: 803/1067 \n",
    "Score for negative class: 788/1067**\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 1067 reviews, my model is able to classify 803 of them properly for postive class and 788 of them for negative class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding scores in percentage are:\\\n",
    "**Percentage of correct postive reviews:  75.25773195876289\n",
    "Percentage of correct negative reviews:  73.8519212746017**\n",
    "\n",
    "**So overall accuracy of my model on 2000 reviews (1000 for each class) is 74.44%**\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance can be improved by using proper preprocessing of the text datasets and a lot of such training datasets. No words should have to be filtered out just based on its composition of the character. Proper stemming of words could also result in better model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in conclusion, if I improve my text processing then this Naive Bayes classifier will definitely perform better.\n",
